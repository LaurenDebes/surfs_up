## Overview of Surfs Up Analysis
We are reaching out to an investor name W. Avy regarding our idea to open a surfboard and ice cream shop in Hawaii. He has concerns about the weather and wants us to run some data analytics from the island we want to open the shop, Oahu. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December to see if the shop is sustainable year-round. 

## Surfs Up Results

**Major Findings:** 
Three major discoveries from the analysis:
  - The average temperature of June (75 degrees) vs December (71 degrees) was fairly similar.
  - The maximum temperature was also fairly similar between June (85 degrees) and December (83 degrees)
  - The temperature minimum for December was 12 degrees lower (64 for June versus 56 for December); however, the quartiles remained fairly similar.

## Surfs Up Summary
**Additional Queries:**

Two additional queries were performed to look at precipitation values for June and December. The average precipitation rose nearly 64% from June (.14) to December (.22).

**High-Level Summary:**
By comparing June and December, where we would assume June would have the highest temperature and December would have the lowest, we can anticipate ice cream sales. Although the average temperature generally remains moderate (with averages in the mid-to-low 70s) this provides some stability. Customers may be spending time outdoors and can get ice cream all year around. However, rain increases in December which may lead to lost revenue. I would advise providing indoor seating or reducing staff during months with higher levels of precipitation. In general, those visiting Oahu would likely love to enjoy the surf and ice cream shop!
